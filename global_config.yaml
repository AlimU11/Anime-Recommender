# config containing global variables

# CHUNCK_SIZE - specifies the number of records to be processed during one iteration
#               for computing similarity scores.
#
#               This is done to avoid excessive memory consumption due to cloud compute limitations.
#               According to local tests, the value of 1000 has practically no impact on calculation time,
#               but 16.7 times less memory is consumed. The results of chunked calculations are
#               also almost the same (corr coef > 0.999) as for non-chunked calculations.
#               The actual difference is the result of precision changes (float64 to float16
#               to reduce RAM consumption) and common 'float values inaccuracy' while the order
#               of operations (dot product, vector sum and precision change) is not the same.
#               Moreover, it was found that the result difference leads to swapping of individual pairs of
#               titles in some rare cases, which slightly affects the final result. However, this behaviour
#               considered as acceptable approximation.
